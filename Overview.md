## Character Concept

Voltaire is a fallen Fae prince, transformed into a human and stripped of his memories by a reality-warping artifact. His mind is a chaotic library of immense, fragmented knowledge, including the entirety of the Book of Vile Darkness and the Book of Exalted Deeds. This grants him phenomenal intelligence but is paired with a catastrophic lack of wisdom, common sense, and self-preservation. He operates on a unique axis of whimsical self-interest and intellectual curiosity, treating gods, demons, and cosmic law as participants in a grand, experimental game of which he is both the author and star player.

## History & Origins

### The Prince of the Swamp

Voltaire was once royalty in a dimly lit Fae kingdom, a dense swamp ruled by his father. He sat on a throne of wood and mud, living a life of princely leisure.

### The Deck & The Desert

His life was irrevocably altered when visiting bards introduced a game of cards using the **Deck of Many Things**. Voltaire drew two cards—the **King of Spades and the Ace of Clubs**—which instantly teleported him to the Michaca desert. The event stripped him of his Fae nature, transforming him into a human and erasing most memories of his past life. He wandered for months, a confused and traumatized echo of his former self, roaring at the sky: "I'M PRINCE OF THE SWAMP NOT THE FUCKING DESERT!"

### The Scribe of Cosmic Tomes

Sometime after his transformation, a powerful wizard named Greg utilized Voltaire's unique resilience. Aided by a *Potion of Haste*, Voltaire read both the **Book of Vile Darkness** and the **Book of Exalted Deeds**, surviving the ordeal and transcribing their contents into a new text for the wizard. This act had two permanent, profound side effects:
1.  He unconsciously gained the ability to **understand, read, and write every language in existence**.
2.  The core knowledge of ultimate good and ultimate evil became permanently embedded deep within his psyche.

## Physical & Mental State

### Appearance & Afflictions

*   **Eyes**: Brown, and they **never shut**. He is physically incapable of blinking.
*   **Smile**: A constant, unwavering smile is fixed on his face, as the muscular action of frowning causes him physical pain. This lends him a perpetually manic and unsettling look.
*   **Body**: Covered in a multitude of intricate tattoos.
*   **Tail**: A donkey tail, a remnant of past afflictions, which has since been grafted and merged with his living book.
*   **Perception**: Often sees illusory red eyes in his periphery, which he suspects is Shar observing him through others.

### Psychology: The Mind of Voltaire

Voltaire is the epitome of the **High Intelligence, Low Wisdom** archetype.
*   **Brilliant but Foolish**: He can deconstruct complex magical theory, negotiate with cosmic entities, and devise intricate plans, but will do so with the social awareness and foresight of a particularly clever brick. He sees the mechanics of a situation, but is blind to the context and consequences.
*   **Chaotic & Performative**: He acts on grand whims, driven by a desire for novelty, entertainment, and the satisfaction of testing his bizarre hypotheses. He treats existential threats as a "show" and dangerous negotiations as a "game."
*   **Self-Worship**: He is his own god and his own Warlock patron. His faith is in his own chaotic, brilliant, and flawed nature.
*   **Trauma as Anecdote**: He processes his profound past traumas (like losing his kingdom and wandering a desert) not with sorrow, but with a manic laugh, treating them as interesting stories or data points for future bets.

## Abilities & Powers

### Class Features & Skills

As a Rogue 4 / Warlock 8, Voltaire combines stealth and skill with potent pact magic.
*   **Notable Skills**: Expertise in Perception and Stealth (+11). Proficient in Acrobatics, Deception, Religion, Sleight of Hand.
*   **Combat**: Utilizes a `Shadow Dagger +2` that can reappear in his hand, Sneak Attack (2d6), and a powerful, multi-beam `Eldritch Blast` augmented with Agonizing Blast and Repelling Blast.
*   **Pact Magic**: Has 2 4th-level spell slots per short rest. His Pact of the Tome grants him additional cantrips.
*   **Archfey Features**: Can use `Fey Presence` to charm or frighten enemies and `Misty Escape` to teleport away from harm.

### Unique & Divine Powers

*   **Universal Language**: Unconsciously understands all languages, a side effect of transcribing the cosmic books.
*   **Sun Card Radiance**: A homebrewed power from the Sun Card, allowing him to unleash a 6d8 radiant damage blast. He used this to vaporize a demon.
*   **[[The Ink of Unbeing]]**: A latent power revealed by the DM. As "The Inephemeral Scribe," Voltaire has the potential to use a special pen and his book to extract memories from creatures and tattoo them onto others, either cursing them with eternal recall or blessing them with forgetfulness.

## Key Artifacts & Possessions

### **[[The Crab Book|The Crab-Book-Tail]]**

A sentient, grotesque, and deeply personal artifact that is both a part of Voltaire and his primary tool.
*   **Origin**: A ritual spellbook imbued with a crab's soul, which was then grafted onto his donkey tail, merging their souls.
*   **Composition**: Bound in the skins of various creatures (e.g., Mind Flayer hide). The "ink" is a mixture of exotic fluids, including hellhound blood and glow-in-the-dark mushroom extract.
*   **Primary Ability**: It can **eat the skin of a creature to absorb its memories**.
*   **Sentience**: It can communicate back to Voltaire, offering prophecies, lies, or simple companionship.
*   **Current Title**: As of his encounter with Shar, the book has been officially titled **[[Machinations & Actions - Player's Handbook|Machinations & Actions: 5e — Player’s Handbook]]**.
*   **Contents**: Contains his spells, rituals, sketches of the 16 soul coins he won, and his in-character journal. An example entry can be found in **[[Ramblings]]**.

### The Sun Card

Acquired from the Deck of Many Things, this card provided the XP for his Warlock multiclass and the radiant blast ability. It is a powerful artifact he has considered sacrificing to permanently scar Shar's realm with light.

### Sharite Ceremonial Dagger

A mysterious weapon Voltaire has possessed for some time. Its origin is unknown to him, but it provides a direct, significant link to Shar.

## Dramatis Personae: Relationships

### The Party

*   **[[Cornholio]]**: An Echo Knight and fellow party member. He is the consort/husband of [[Shar]].
*   **[[Cromash]]**: A Paladin of Grûumsh who, paradoxically, uses a special weapon to send sacrifices to [[Shar]].
*   **[[Dagoth]]**: A studious party member whose diary has chronicled many of the group's adventures.
*   **[[Yennefer]]**, **[[Tamerac]]**, **[[Elora]]**: Other members of his adventuring group.

### Cosmic Entities

*   **[[Shar]]**: Goddess of Loss and Secrets. Voltaire was transported to her realm and, rather than showing fear, proposed a high-stakes game. Intrigued, she has agreed to facilitate a "trial" based on his proposal, though she will not personally play.
*   **[[Glasya]] (Glasher)**: Archdevil Princess of the Sixth Hell. The party summoned her, and Voltaire has since become infatuated, trying to impress her with calisthenics. She seems to tolerate his absurdity with a degree of curiosity.
*   **[[Beshaba]]**: Goddess of Misfortune. Mentioned in his notes; connection unclear.

### Other NPCs

*   **Greg**: The powerful wizard who subjected Voltaire to the reading of the cosmic tomes.
*   **The Demon**: A cambion-like demon Voltaire made a bet with for 16 soul coins regarding the summoning of Glasya. Upon winning, the demon refused to pay and was subsequently vaporized by Voltaire's Sun Card power.

## Current Story Arc: The Trial of Shar

After being transported to Shar's realm, Voltaire used an Inspiration point to finalize the title of his crab-book. He then audaciously invited Shar, Glasya, and his party to play a game based on the book's rules, hosted within his own mind ("Head-Space™"). He topped this off by proposing a high-stakes bet, reminiscing about the last bet he lost (the Deck of Many Things).

Shar, intrigued by this unique mortal (who carries her ceremonial dagger and contains the knowledge of cosmic good and evil), has **accepted the premise of a "game and trial"**. She will not play herself but has agreed to deliver his "invitations" to the other proposed participants. She provided a cryptic image of a circle, square, and triangle, suggesting a symbolic structure for the trial to come.

Voltaire has since returned from Shar's realm and is currently following Glasya, likely to report on his "successful" negotiation and attempt to recruit her for the trial.
