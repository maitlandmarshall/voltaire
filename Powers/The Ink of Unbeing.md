**Origin**: "Gift of the House Sharimythal"
**Associated Role**: "The Inephemeral Scribe"

The Ink of Unbeing is not a physical item but a profound magical ability related to the transference and erasure of memory. Revealed to [[Voltaire]] by the DM following his encounter with [[Shar]], this power is thematically linked to the goddess's portfolio of loss and secrets and seems to be a latent part of Voltaire's destiny. It provides a potential in-universe explanation for the mechanics of his [[Crab Book|crab-book-tail]] and his affinity for tattoos.

## The Mechanism

The process of using the Ink of Unbeing is described as a specific, ritualistic sequence:

1.  **The Scribe**: The wielder, known as "The Inephemeral Scribe," must possess two key components: the **Book of Hollow Binding** and a **pen carved from the voidbone of his former self**.
2.  **Extraction**: Using the pen, the Scribe can draw forth a memory directly from a source—be it living flesh, a dying gasp, or even a lingering psychic echo ("whisper or scream").
3.  **Inscription**: The extracted memory is inscribed into the Book of Hollow Binding, where it is transformed into a "fleshless truth." The book does not simply store the data; it *remembers* it on a fundamental level.
4.  **Transference**: The Scribe can then reverse the process, using the ink on the pen to tattoo the memory from the book onto the skin of another creature.

## The Dual Effect: A Scribe's Decision

The core of this power lies in the choice the Scribe makes during the transference. The Scribe does not judge the morality of the memory, but simply **decides** its fate:

*   **Blessing of Forgetfulness**: The Scribe can choose to gift forgetfulness. The tattoo appears on the recipient's skin, and as the magical glyph fades, so too does the memory from their mind, leaving a void where it once was.
*   **Curse of Eternal Recall**: The Scribe can choose to curse the recipient with remembrance. The tattoo becomes a permanent, living glyph on their skin. It will **glow when the memory is recalled**, serving as a constant, inescapable reminder that can never fade.

## Connection to Voltaire

This power is deeply intertwined with [[Voltaire]]'s entire being, even if he is not yet fully aware of it.

*   **The Book of Hollow Binding**: Voltaire's [[Crab Book|crab-book-tail]]—a sentient grimoire made of creature skin that hungers for memories—is almost certainly this artifact.
*   **The Voidbone Pen**: The description of a pen "carved from the voidbone of his former self" is a powerful metaphor for Voltaire's transformation from a Fae Prince into a human. This suggests the key to unlocking this power may lie in confronting or utilizing a remnant of his lost Fae nature.
*   **The Tattoos**: Voltaire is already covered in tattoos. It's possible some of them are forgotten memories—his own or others'—that he has inscribed on himself in the past.
*   **House Sharimythal**: The name of the house associated with this power is strikingly similar to **Shar**. This implies the power may originate from her, be a splinter sect, or be a title she bestows. This makes Voltaire's potential as The Scribe of immense interest to the Lady of Loss.
*   **The Trial**: This ability is a perfect tool or test for the "game/trial" Shar is facilitating. She may task him with using it to prove his worth or understanding.
