**Affiliation**: The Party
**Known For**: Archery, impromptu arena combat, prophetic poetry

Elora is a formidable warrior within the party, known for her sharp skills with a bow and her readiness to engage in combat. While less is detailed about her personal history in the provided notes, her actions show a character who is direct, brave, and strangely receptive to the cryptic, mystical events that surround the group.

## Narrative Arc & Key Events

Elora's key moments often involve her being a willing participant in the party's strangest encounters, acting as a physical catalyst or a surprising source of insight.

### Abeil Arena Champion

During the party's downtime in the Abeil Hive City, Elora wasted no time in testing her mettle. She actively participated in impromptu arena battles against the Abeil guards, establishing herself as a capable and fearless combatant among the fey-like bee creatures.

### The Vision of Moon and Blood

When the party discovered a strange divine scroll beneath [[Palischuk]], several members were hesitant to interact with it. Elora, however, took the scroll and a `Helm of Comprehending Languages` without fear. She heated the scroll, an act which plunged her into a vision where she heard a cryptic poem:

> Silver moon in sky so high,
> Whispers secrets as winds sigh.
> Blood on earth, beneath its glow,
> Tells of battles long ago.
> Silent watcher, cold and bright,
> Bathes the darkness in soft light.
> Moon and blood, both tied to fate,
> Eternal dance of love and hate.

This prophetic verse, dubbed her "Moon Ego-Death," foreshadowed the party's later encounters with themes of divinity, sacrifice, and the influence of [[Shar]].

### Tactical Combatant

In combat situations, Elora is often at the forefront, using her archery to control the battlefield. During the first fight against the Mother Hydra-worshipping Abeils, it was she who was made invisible by [[Dagoth]] to scout, and her arrow shot that initiated the combat. Her tactical prowess was brutally effective, as she was responsible for shooting the legs off the enemy priestess.

## Relationship with Voltaire

[[Voltaire]]'s perception of Elora is, like his view of the others, filtered through his unique intellectual lens. For his "Head-Space™" game, he has included her as part of the "full, chaotic symphony" of the party, specifically noting her **"sharp perceptions."** This indicates that Voltaire's High Intelligence, at least, recognizes her as a keen and observant individual. However, his Low Wisdom likely prevents him from appreciating the bravery or potential insight behind those perceptions. He sees her as a sharp tool or a precise sensor in his grand experiment, valuable for the clear data she provides, rather than as a person.

## Notable Abilities & Possessions

*   **Master Archer**: Her primary and most noted skill is her deadly accuracy with a bow.
*   **Corpse Mushrooms**: During her time in the Abeil Hive City, she "made off with as many bags as she can carry" of these unique fungi, showing a resourceful and opportunistic nature.
*   **Prophetic Receptiveness**: Unlike some of her more cynical or cautious companions, she seems open to interacting with strange divine artifacts, making her a potential conduit for visions and prophecies.
