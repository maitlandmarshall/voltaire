**Title**: Lord of Palashaey
**Class**: Paladin of Grûumsh
**Affiliation**: The Party, Lord of Palashaey, Unwitting/Unwilling "Patron" of Shar's Realm

Cromash is a half-orc Paladin of Grûumsh and a noble lord of the city of Palashaey. He is a deeply complex individual who adheres to his own unique code of conduct, which includes a bizarrely antagonistic and transactional relationship with the goddess [[Shar]]. He is known in the Shadowfell as a minor celebrity for the sheer volume of "donations" he sends her way.

## Narrative Arc & Key Events

Cromash's actions often have wide-reaching and unexpected consequences, driven by his unique interpretation of faith and annoyance.

### Collapsing a Demi-Plane

During an exploration of a shrine tainted by the influence of a mad blood god, Cromash found himself facing a star vampire attacking the party from a blood portal. In a decisive act, he thrust his **soul-sending sword** through the portal and slew the creature. This act, sending an unwelcome star vampire to [[Shar]]'s realm, had the catastrophic side effect of collapsing the entire demi-plane of blood into the Shadowfell. This event caused numerous blood cults across the planes to lose their powers. When later questioned by a Harper agent, Cromash's deadpan explanation and the sheer audacity of the act were found to be "incredibly funny."

### Celebrity Status in the Shadowfell

When the party was transported to Shar's realm, they encountered a group of Shadar-kai who immediately recognized Cromash. Due to his frequent "donations" via his sword, he has gained a reputation among the realm's denizens, who treat him with a strange sort of celebrity reverence.

### Divine Trolling as an Act of Worship

Cromash's primary motivation for sending creatures and objects to [[Shar]] is not devotion but a unique form of antagonistic worship. He explained to the Harper that he finds it hilarious to send **"dumb shit to Shar that she hates or does not want."** This act of divine trolling is his way of interacting with a power he finds amusing to provoke.

## Relationship with Voltaire

[[Voltaire]] views Cromash with a kind of intellectual simplification. In his notes for the "Head-Space™" game, Voltaire designated Cromash as the **"control group: straightforward moral axis."** This highlights [[Voltaire]]'s profound lack of wisdom, as he completely misses the complex, contradictory, and chaotic nature of Cromash's faith and actions. He sees a simple Paladin, failing to recognize the master-level divine troll standing next to him.
