**Affiliation**: The Party
**Race**: Tiefling

Yennefer is a resourceful and often volatile member of the party, a Tiefling who pursues her goals with relentless, and at times, reckless determination. Her recent interactions with both the Abeil Hive City and the divine machinations surrounding [[Shar]] have left her physically and psychically altered, marking her as a wildcard in the group's adventures.

## Narrative Arc & Key Events

Yennefer's journey is one of physical transformation and becoming entangled in the bitter side of divine politics.

### The Gift of Flight

During the party's time in the Abeil Hive City, Yennefer cashed in her reward for a long-term personal goal: the ability to fly. She underwent a dangerous surgery where Abeil healers grafted a pair of their own chitinous wings onto her back. The procedure was successful, but also marked her as "dripping with necromantic residue" in the eyes of the Warlock Knights.

### Gifts from the Lady of Loss

While in [[Shar]]'s restored shrine, [[Cornholio]] placed Yennefer upon the altar. In a shower of divine attention, she received several "gifts":
*   A **+2 magical whip** for self-flagellation.
*   A bottle of **perfume** made from Shadowfell flora.
*   A **letter in Sylvan** which, once translated, was a thank-you note from Shar sarcastically telling her to use the perfume to find a new man.

This interaction established a clear, antagonistic relationship between Yennefer and the goddess.

### The Rivalry for Cornholio

Yennefer developed a conflict with a blue-skinned Tiefling from Sigil named **Sharias** over their mutual interest in [[Cornholio]]. In a tavern, this escalated into a physical confrontation where Yennefer attacked Sharias with her new whip. Sharias, a devout follower of [[Shar]], seemed to enjoy the conflict, calling it a "fun game." The rivalry culminated in Sharias using a *sending* spell to sacrifice Yennefer's pet frog to Shar, an act which left Yennefer with a **purple kiss mark on her forehead** and a compulsion to visit the Raven Queen.

## Relationship with Voltaire

[[Voltaire]]'s highly intelligent but unwise mind has categorized Yennefer in a very specific, utilitarian way for his "Head-Space™" game. He sees her as the **"indispensable catalyst for... well, *unforeseen outcomes*."** He intellectually recognizes her as a powerful agent of chaos, a "wildcard variable" essential for making his experiments interesting and unpredictable. He completely fails to grasp the emotional depth, possessiveness, or personal turmoil driving her actions, viewing her simply as a fascinating and necessary ingredient for his grand, chaotic formula.

## Notable Abilities & Possessions

*   **Grafted Abeil Wings**: A permanent physical modification granting her the ability to fly.
*   **Whip of Flagellation**: A +2 magical whip from Shar that, on hit, sends the shed blood of the target directly to the Shadowfell.
*   **Criminal Contacts**: Possesses connections within the criminal underworld, which she used to contact the Harpers.
*   **Purple Kiss Mark**: A divine mark from Shar that is pushing her towards a future encounter with the Raven Queen.
*   **Tony the Lizard**: An awakened pet lizard that Yennefer is attempting to train (or brainwash) through questionable methods.
