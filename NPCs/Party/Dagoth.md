**Affiliation**: The Party
**Class**: Warlock
**Known For**: Diligent record-keeping, ritual casting, scientific curiosity

Dagoth is the party's primary intellectual and chronicler, a Warlock whose approach to the arcane is more akin to a scientist than a traditional spellcaster. He meticulously documents the group's adventures in his diary, providing a crucial record of events, items, and interactions. His constant pursuit of knowledge and samples often puts him at odds with the party's more chaotic elements, but his skills in ritual casting and identification are invaluable.

## Narrative Arc & Key Events

Dagoth's journey often involves him trying to bring logic and order to the sheer chaos generated by his companions, all while furthering his own research.

### Rescue and The Hive City

Dagoth's history with the party began when they found him "trapped" in a wall near a temple later defiled by [[Tamerac]]. Since then, he has been a steadfast, if sometimes bewildered, member. In the Abeil Hive City, he demonstrated his dedication to research by spending days getting certifications to access the library, learning new rituals, and studying Abeil craftsmanship. It was his expertise that identified various found objects, from the `Carrion Crawler Brain Juice` trap to the `Implements of Mother Hydra`.

### The Visionary

Though he approaches things with a scholarly air, Dagoth is not immune to the planes' weirdness. When interacting with a divine scroll beneath [[Palischuk]], he entered a trance and found himself surrounded by **56 flumphs with Jamaican accents**—a bizarre vision that stands in stark contrast to his usually serious demeanor.

### Unraveling Mysteries

Dagoth's keen eye and magical knowledge have been instrumental in identifying numerous threats and artifacts. He was the one to finally identify the "red goo blasters" as **Eldritch Casters** and provide a detailed breakdown of their function. He is frequently called upon to use his `Wand of Magic Detection` and ritual casting to understand the strange items the party acquires.

### Recent Activities

Recently, Dagoth has been focused on practical matters, from helping [[Cornholio]] upgrade the party carriage to acquiring various supplies. He summoned a non-standard Owl Familiar with a third, rotated eye, which he found "rather perturbing" and shunted to a pocket dimension. During the fight at the Tiamat shrine, he was so incensed by [[Tamerac]]'s veneration of Tiamat that he attempted to destroy his instrument with an `Eldritch Caster` and silence him with `Bigby's Hand`.

## Relationship with Voltaire

[[Voltaire]] views Dagoth through the lens of High Intelligence recognizing its peer, but with a complete lack of wisdom regarding his personality. For the "Head-Space™" game, Voltaire has cast Dagoth in the role of **"meticulous rules arbitration and appreciating the intricate systemic beauty."** Voltaire correctly identifies Dagoth's love for systems and rules, but frames it as a purely intellectual appreciation. He's also added a characteristically arrogant and self-aware jab, noting Dagoth is **"perhaps prone to excessive marginalia, unlike *my* concise footnotes."** He sees Dagoth as a necessary referee and fellow intellectual for his game, failing to see the exasperated man who is often simply trying to survive the chaos Voltaire creates.
