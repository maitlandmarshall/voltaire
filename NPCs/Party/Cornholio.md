**Aliases**: Shrek
**Affiliation**: The Party, Chosen of Shar

A key member of the party, Cornholio is an Echo Knight whose destiny has become deeply and bizarrely intertwined with that of [[Shar]], the Goddess of Loss. He serves as both a formidable ally and a direct, personal link to one of the most powerful and enigmatic beings in the cosmos.

## Narrative Arc & Key Events

Cornholio's journey has been marked by a significant transformation from a somewhat cautious adventurer into the chosen consort of a greater deity.

### The Mines of Palischuk & The Vision

While investigating tunnels beneath [[Palischuk]], Cornholio discovered a curious golden tiara in an elven-style bone box. This discovery triggered a series of prophetic visions. After interacting with a divine scroll, he experienced a vision of being deep underwater, with moonlight shining down and countless red eyes looking up at him—a clear foreshadowing of his connection to [[Shar]].

### The Shrine & The Transformation

The party later discovered a defiled area that, once cleansed, was revealed to be a lost shrine to [[Shar]]. In a pivotal moment, Cornholio took the golden tiara, fitted it with the necessary gems, and placed it upon a statue of the goddess. The item was transformed into the **[[Shadow's Weave]]**, a powerful silver/mithril circlet. Upon placing it on his own head, he felt an immediate, profound connection to Shar, gaining a raven guide and enhanced senses.

He furthered his devotion by offering a `Staff of Mother Hydra` to the shrine, which was transformed into **[[Shadow's Fell]]**. Following these events, he was briefly taken by Shar, where he formally became her consort and "favourite mortal."

### Recent Activities

Since his return, Cornholio has been instrumental in party activities, including upgrading the party's carriage and dealing with the Warlock Knights of Palischuk. During the final confrontation at the Tiamat shrine, he was present when [[Voltaire]] was transported to Shar's realm. He is currently not in Shar's realm but remains on the Prime Material Plane where the battle took place.

## Relationship with Voltaire

Voltaire perceives Cornholio with a mix of camaraderie and strategic interest. He is keenly aware that Cornholio is Shar's consort ("your fella, right?"), a fact he views as a fascinating social and tactical variable. Voltaire has nominated Cornholio as a key participant in his proposed "Head-Space™" game, citing his "matrimonial adjacency" as a factor that might boost Shar's attendance or interest.
