**Aliases**: Tamarac, Tamerenac
**Affiliation**: The Party, Unwitting Agent of Tiamat
**Known For**: Musical magic, extreme volatility, a literal portal in his eye socket

Tamerac is a Bard whose connection to magic and reality has become dangerously frayed. Once a servant of Tiamat, he was supposedly freed of her control, yet he continues to venerate her and his actions have become increasingly erratic and destructive. His slide into insanity makes him one of the most unpredictable and perilous members of the party.

## Narrative Arc & Key Events

Tamerac's story is a tragic descent into madness, marked by moments of cosmic significance and self-destruction.

### The Eye of Avernus

During a confrontation with a Tiamat cult, Tamerac lost his eye to a jet of blood. A Harper agent later inspected the empty socket and identified it as a **semi-permanent gate to Avernus**, the first layer of the Nine Hells. While limited by its small size, it remains a direct, physical link to the plane of devils, a feature that deeply concerns outside observers but is largely treated as another strange quirk by the party.

### Defiling the Temple

It was Tamerac who single-handedly consecrated a temple they had cleared into a **shrine of Tiamat**, establishing a foothold for the Dragon Queen's cult in the tunnels beneath [[Palischuk]]. This act had major repercussions, forcing the Warlock Knights to strike a bargain with the cultists to ensure the city's water security.

### Insanity and Self-Destruction

Tamerac's behavior has grown progressively more unhinged. He has been observed casting Legend Lore on a heretical book from [[Glasya]], resulting in an epileptic fit and bleeding from his eyes. He often venerates Tiamat at the most inopportune moments, such as during the party's flight from the Tiamat shrine, which provoked [[Dagoth]] to attack him.

His final act (for now) was to chase after the Archdevil [[Glasya]] in a fit of madness, intending to "annoy" her. Glasya, unimpressed, summoned an Erinyes that dispatched him with little effort. He was left on the ground making death saving throws, with his player requesting that he not be revived. His corpse remains with the party.

## Relationship with Voltaire

[[Voltaire]], in his characteristic High INT/Low WIS fashion, doesn't see a tragic figure teetering on the brink of madness. Instead, he sees a source of interesting, unpredictable data. In his participant list for the "Head-Space™" game, he files Tamerac under **"discordant notes"** within the "full, chaotic symphony" of the party. He views Tamerac's insanity not as a flaw or a danger, but as a unique and valuable contribution to the overall chaos of his experiment. He appreciates Tamerac's role as an agent of unpredictability, essential for a truly chaotic game.

## Notable Abilities & Possessions

*   **Bardic Magic**: Wields magic through music and performance, though this has become increasingly unstable.
*   **Gate to Avernus**: His empty eye socket is a permanent, if small, portal to the Nine Hells.
*   **Connection to Tiamat**: Despite supposedly being freed, he maintains a strong link to the Dragon Queen, acting as her agent in the Prime Material Plane.
*   **The Heretical Book**: A strange, golden-bound book given to him by [[Glasya]] that seems to cause physical harm to those who try to identify it. Its status is unknown since his death.
