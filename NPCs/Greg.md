**Title**: The Catalyst Wizard
**Known For**: Immense magical power, morally ambiguous methods

Greg is a powerful wizard who played a pivotal, albeit manipulative, role in Voltaire's past. He is directly responsible for two of [[Voltaire]]'s most significant latent abilities, having used him as a tool to achieve a goal of immense arcane and cosmic importance.

## The Transcription of the Cosmic Tomes

Greg possessed or had access to two of the most dangerous and powerful books in the multiverse: the **[[Book of Vile Darkness]]** and the **[[Book of Exalted Deeds]]**. Unable or unwilling to risk reading them himself, he devised a plan using [[Voltaire]] as a conduit.

*   **The Method**: Greg administered a **Potion of Haste** to [[Voltaire]] and compelled him to read both ancient tomes.
*   **The Outcome for Greg**: The plan was a success. [[Voltaire]] survived the psychic onslaught of reading both artifacts and was able to transcribe their contents from their original, potent languages into a new, unified book that Greg could study without risk.
*   **The Outcome for Voltaire**: While [[Voltaire]] was a tool in this process, he was permanently and profoundly changed by it. The act of serving as a filter for these cosmic concepts left him with two incredible, unconscious abilities:
    1.  **Universal Language**: He can implicitly understand, read, and write every language in existence.
    2.  **Indwelling Knowledge**: The fundamental truths of ultimate evil and ultimate good are now embedded deep within his psyche, a source of immense latent power and potential inner conflict.

## Relationship with Voltaire

[[Voltaire]]'s relationship with Greg is complex and likely colored by his High INT/Low WIS perspective.
*   **A Source of Knowledge**: Voltaire learned the powerful **Demon Gate spell** from Greg, indicating a period of tutelage or at least a significant exchange of knowledge.
*   **A Means to an End**: Greg clearly "used" Voltaire, endangering his life and sanity for personal gain.
*   **Voltaire's View**: Due to his Low Wisdom, [[Voltaire]] likely doesn't dwell on the moral implications or the danger he was put in. He would respect Greg's power and intelligence (High INT) but would likely see their interaction as a fascinating, transactional event—an experiment he was a part of—rather than a moment of gross manipulation (Low WIS). He may even view Greg with a strange sort of fondness as the one who unlocked these interesting (if unconscious) new skills.

## Current Status & Mysteries

*   Where is Greg now?
*   What was his ultimate purpose for the newly transcribed book?
*   Does he know the full extent of the side effects his experiment had on [[Voltaire]]?
*   Could he reappear as a powerful, unpredictable ally or a formidable antagonist seeking to further use his "successful" test subject?
