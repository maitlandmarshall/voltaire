# Voltaire D&D Repository

This repository collects all information about the character **Voltaire** and the surreal world inside his mind.

* `VDD.json` – a conversational log with an AI brainstorming Voltaire's history and the tone of an adventure.
* `dm/` – planning material for a D&D campaign based on those ideas.

The goal is to document Voltaire's backstory, goals and strange powers, then craft an episodic campaign full of bizarre encounters and creepy horror fun.
