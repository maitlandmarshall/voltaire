# Voltaire

A mysterious figure who once transcribed both the **Book of Vile Darkness** and the **Book of Exalted Deeds** under the influence of a potion of haste. The process left him forever altered:

- **Universal Understanding** – Voltaire can read and write every language intuitively, though he does so unconsciously.
- **Arcane Tattoos** – His body is covered in strange markings. His eyes never close and it physically hurts when he frowns, leaving him with a constant unsettling smile.
- **Crab Book** – A bizarre tome that consumes the skin of creatures and absorbs lingering memories.
- **Allies & Foes** – He has ties to a wizard named Greg, demons, and the goddess Shar. One party member is even married to Shar.

Voltaire's mind is a labyrinth of horror imagery, from crawling crabs and ink-stained pages to warped Fae creatures. The party must delve into this mindscape to uncover his desires and the mysteries surrounding his past.
