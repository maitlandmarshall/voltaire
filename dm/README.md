# Voltaire's Mindscape Campaign

This folder will hold notes and episode outlines for a horror-themed adventure set inside Voltaire's mind. The ideas are drawn from the conversation in `../VDD.json`.

## Current Outline

1. **Setting** – The party is dragged into Voltaire's warped mental realm where reality behaves like a grotesque pop-up book.
2. **Goal** – Escape the labyrinth of Voltaire's memories and nightmares while piecing together his motives and powers.
3. **Tone** – Surreal horror with dark humor. Use elements like skin-bound books, bizarre libraries and unsettling nursery scenes.

Future documents will expand on Voltaire's backstory, key NPCs and episodic scenarios.
