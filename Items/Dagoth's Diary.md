**Author**: [[Dagoth]]
**Type**: In-Character Chronicle

Dagoth's Diary is the meticulous and ongoing record of the party's adventures, as documented by the studious and observant Warlock, [[Dagoth]]. Written from his perspective, the diary is an invaluable in-universe resource, providing a timeline of events, detailed descriptions of discovered items, and [[Dagoth]]'s personal analysis and opinions on the often chaotic situations the party finds itself in.

## Content and Style

The diary is characterized by [[Dagoth]]'s scholarly and slightly clinical tone. He documents events with a focus on observable facts, magical phenomena, and tactical analysis. His entries often betray a sense of scientific curiosity, as well as a recurring bewilderment and occasional exasperation at the actions of his more impulsive companions. The diary contains:

*   **Session Notes**: Detailed accounts of quests, combats, and explorations.
*   **Item Identification**: Descriptions and analyses of magical and mundane items the party discovers, such as the `Implements of Mother Hydra` and the `Eldritch Casters`.
*   **Character Observations**: [[Dagoth]]'s personal thoughts on his fellow party members, such as his confusion at [[Yennefer]]'s "rude and belligerent" behavior or his annoyance at [[Tamerac]]'s slide into insanity.
*   **Personal Experiences**: Records of his own unique encounters, like the vision of 56 Jamaican-accented flumphs.

## Significance to the Campaign

*   **Primary Chronicle**: It serves as the most comprehensive in-character history of the campaign, preserving details that characters (and players) might otherwise forget.
*   **Source of Truth**: It is the source document for many of the detailed events, such as the specific items found in the Abeil mines, the timeline of the party's interactions with the Harpers, and the sequence of events leading to [[Tamerac]]'s demise.
*   **Character Insight**: The diary provides deep insight into [[Dagoth]]'s personality, revealing him to be a logical, inquisitive, and order-seeking individual struggling to make sense of a world—and a party—defined by chaos.
*   **Potential Plot Hook**: As a written record of sensitive and powerful events, the diary itself could become a valuable and dangerous artifact. If it were to fall into the wrong hands, the information it contains about the party's actions, weaknesses, and discoveries could be used against them. For a being like [[Shar]] or [[Glasya]], such a detailed account would be a treasure trove of intelligence.
