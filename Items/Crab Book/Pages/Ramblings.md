### Field Journal – Provisional Entry — Location: *Unspecified Umbral Salon*

One finds oneself, rather abruptly, recipient of an interplanar summons to... well, here. An environment of profound and frankly rather *oppressive* quietude. Presiding over this domain, judging by the sheer gravitational pull of ambient gloom, is the entity designated Shar. She observes with a stillness that borders on the artistic – a sort of terminal understatement. Fascinating, in a static sort of way.

No matter. Priorities dictate immediate attention to Project Codex. Serendipitously, arrival coincided with a jolt of pure Inspiration (ah, the *genuine* article!), resolving that troublesome subtitle conundrum with elegant finality. Thus, the Magnum Opus is now officially designated: **“Machinations & Actions: 5e — Player’s Handbook.”** The inscription glows most satisfactorily upon the cover; intellectual neatness achieved.

With editorial matters settled, my attention returns to the immediate variable: the host entity, Shar. Her continued proximity, combined with a distinct lack of overt hostility, presents an *unparalleled* opportunity for practical demonstration. The Handbook, you see, demands validation through applied trial. Therefore, the logical progression is to propose a structured gaming session – a practicum, if you will. Venue: naturally, my own curated mental environment, the Head-Space™. Infinitely configurable, excellent spectral catering, zero dimensional overhead.

The ideal participants assemble readily in the mind's eye:
*   **Shar** herself, providing essential thematic resonance and, let's be honest, a certain cachet.
*   **Cornholio**, whose marital affiliation might encourage attendance – strategic thinking!
*   **Cromash**, valuable for his predictable moral vector. A baseline.
*   **Yennefer**, the indispensable catalyst for... well, *unforeseen outcomes*.
*   **Dagoth**, of course, for meticulous rules arbitration and appreciating the intricate systemic beauty (though perhaps prone to excessive marginalia, unlike *my* concise footnotes).
*   And naturally, the remainder of our usual adventuring ensemble – Tamerac's discordant notes, Elora's sharp perceptions, the full, chaotic symphony!
*   Finally, **Glasya**. Her demonstrated appreciation for rigorous systems (and quality literature, such as my own manifold works) makes her an essential intellectual counterpoint.

(Invitations shall be mentally drafted pending the primary Entity's acceptance. Prompt RSVPs appreciated for scheduling.)

Now, for *gravitas*. A mere game lacks narrative weight without tangible consequence. Recalling my own formative experience post-Deck interaction (an extended, albeit character-building, desert sojourn), a wager seems non-negotiable. I propose stakes involving significant personal inconvenience or unique conceptual barter – rare spell components, linguistic secrets, perhaps limited temporal paradox rights? I remain open to negotiation with the Lady of Loss.

Regarding scheduling this confluence: coordinating across planar boundaries and divine/infernal calendars suggests a lead time. **Three full lunar cycles hence** possesses a pleasingly traditional ring to it. Barring unforeseen armageddons, of course.

In essence, the situation is well in hand. The Codex is titled. The primary participant is present. A proposal for a structured, high-stakes, multi-planar gaming session hosted within my own psyche is formulated and ready for delivery. All proceeds according to a perfectly rational, albeit inventive, sequence. One anticipates... data.
