**Official Title**: Machinations & Actions: 5e — Player’s Handbook
**Author**: [[Voltaire]]
**Alternate Designation**: Project Codex, The Big Project

This is not a mere book, but the newly designated identity of [[Voltaire]]'s sentient, soul-merged **[[Crab Book|crab-book-tail]]**. It is his magnum opus, an attempt by his brilliant but unwise mind to codify the very laws of reality into a playable game. It is a legendary artifact in the making, born from chaos, inscribed in blasphemy, and central to his current interactions with the divine.

## The Christening in Shadow

The book received its official title in the most audacious circumstances imaginable. Upon being transported to the realm of [[Shar]], the Lady of Loss, [[Voltaire]] was struck by a moment of pure, chaotic inspiration. Disregarding the goddess entirely, he sat upon the floor of her sanctum and, with immense satisfaction, inscribed the final, perfect title onto the book's cover. This act—of defining the rules of existence at the feet of a deity who embodies the void—is the foundational act of this artifact's new identity.

## Nature and Content

While titled like a simple game manual, the *Machinations & Actions* handbook is a deeply complex and meta-narrative object.

*   **A Living Rulebook**: The content is, quite literally, an in-universe version of the Dungeons & Dragons Player's Handbook. [[Voltaire]] is not inventing rules so much as *documenting* the physics and metaphysics of his reality, as perceived by his High Intelligence.
*   **The Medium is the Message**: The rules are inscribed on the flayed skins of the creatures they might pertain to, using their blood as ink. The chapter on Barbarian Rage might be written on the hide of a great beast, while the rules for divine magic could be penned on the skin of a fallen celestial or fiend, using its own essence as the medium.
*   **A Mind Made Manifest**: The book is [[Voltaire]]'s attempt to impose a logical (if game-like) structure on a chaotic universe. It is the ultimate expression of his High INT (the ability to perceive and document these systems) and his Low WIS (the sheer audacity to believe this is a normal and sensible thing to do).

## Cosmic Significance

The existence of this book is of profound interest to cosmic entities. A mortal who has not only perceived but *codified* the underlying rules of reality is a figure of immense power or transcendent madness. To beings like [[Shar]] and [[Glasya]], it represents either the ultimate secret to be claimed or the ultimate blasphemy to be punished.

It now serves as the proposed rulebook for the **divine trial** being facilitated by [[Shar]], making it the central pillar of the entire story arc. Voltaire's intent to host a game in his "Head-Space™" using these rules is a direct link between the player's meta-activity (hosting one-shots) and the character's in-game actions.

## Mysteries & Plot Hooks

*   Does altering an entry in the book have any effect on reality itself?
*   What memories, absorbed from the skins it's made of, are embedded within the very rules written on the pages?
*   What would happen if another being, like [[Shar]] or [[Glasya]], were to write a new chapter?
