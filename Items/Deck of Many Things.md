**Type**: Wondrous Item, Legendary Artifact
**Known For**: Game-altering, reality-bending effects; extreme risk vs. reward

The Deck of Many Things is one of the most infamous and powerful magical artifacts in existence. It is not merely a tool but a force of chaos, a physical manifestation of fate's caprice that can irrevocably alter the life of anyone who dares to draw from it. The Deck has been the single most defining influence on [[Voltaire]]'s life, serving as the catalyst for his transformation and the source of his recent power-up.

## The First Draw: Voltaire's Origin

Voltaire's first, unwitting interaction with the Deck of Many Things is the cornerstone of his entire backstory.
*   **The Event**: While acting as the Prince of the Swamp, [[Voltaire]] was engaged in a seemingly innocent card game with visiting bards.
*   **The Draw**: He drew two cards from the Deck: the **King of Spades** and the **Ace of Clubs**.
*   **The Consequence**: The draw instantly and catastrophically altered his existence. He was teleported to a desert, stripped of his Fae nature, transformed into a human variant, and lost most memories of his former life. This event, which he now recalls with a kind of manic amusement, is the source of his deepest trauma and the foundation of his fractured identity.

## The Second Draw: The Sun Card

In a more recent session, [[Voltaire]]'s fate once again became entangled with the Deck.
*   **The Draw**: He drew **The Sun** card.
*   **The Consequence**:
    1.  **Massive XP Gain**: The card granted him a significant amount of experience, allowing him to respec and multiclass from a Level 8 Thief into his current Rogue 4 / Warlock 8 build.
    2.  **Radiant Power (Homebrew)**: The DM flavored this boon as a potent new ability. Voltaire gained a powerful radiant light attack, described as dealing **6d8 radiant damage**. This power is particularly effective against demons, as proven when he used it to vaporize a demon who refused to honor a bet.

## Relationship with Voltaire

The Deck is not an item [[Voltaire]] currently possesses, but its influence is permanently woven into his soul.
*   **Agent of Transformation**: It is the direct cause of his fall from grace and his subsequent rise in power.
*   **Source of Trauma & Power**: It represents both the worst and best things that have ever happened to him, a duality that perfectly reflects his chaotic nature.
*   **Chaotic Affinity**: His strong connection to the Deck may be the source of his own burgeoning, god-like chaotic neutral energy. He seems to resonate with its reality-bending properties.
*   **The Bet**: His memory of the first draw—"the last bet I lost"—has become a core part of his personality, a foundational anecdote he uses to justify his love of high-stakes wagers, such as the one he proposed to [[Shar]].
