**Type**: Wondrous Item (Circlet)
**Wielder**: [[Cornholio]]

The *Shadow's Weave* is a powerful divine artifact granted to [[Cornholio]] by [[Shar]]. It is a physical manifestation of his status as her chosen consort and a direct conduit for her power.

## Origin: The Transformation

This artifact was not found, but forged through an act of devotion. Its original form was a **"Curious golden tiara"** with a greenish hue, found by [[Cornholio]] in an elven bone puzzle box (which was later revealed to bear a tiny Harper symbol). The tiara was made of "outsider gold" and was identified as part of the `Implements of Mother Hydra`.

During the party's adventures in the tunnels beneath [[Palischuk]], they cleansed a defiled area, restoring it as a shrine to [[Shar]]. In this sacred space, [[Cornholio]] placed the tiara upon a statue of the goddess. [[Shar]]'s power answered, transforming the item instantly:
*   The large central **ruby** was transmuted into a **moonstone**.
*   The "outsider gold" was purified into a silver/mithril alloy now known as **"lunar silver."**

Upon placing the newly-forged *Shadow's Weave* upon his own head, [[Cornholio]] felt his connection to [[Shar]] solidify.

## Abilities & Powers

As chronicled in [[Dagoth's Diary]], the *Shadow's Weave* grants its wearer several boons:

*   **Trained Raven**: A raven guide remains with the wearer, acting as a companion and likely an agent of [[Shar]].
*   **Shadow Blade**: The wearer can cast the `Shadow Blade` spell once per dawn at 2nd level.
*   **Enhanced Darkvision**: The wearer's darkvision is doubled. If they have none, it becomes 60 ft.
*   **Divine Path**: The artifact allows the wearer to take levels as a Cleric of [[Shar]].

## Significance

The *Shadow's Weave* is the primary symbol of [[Cornholio]]'s bond with the Lady of Loss. It is not merely a magical item but a mark of divine favor, setting him apart as a figure of great importance to one of the most powerful deities in the pantheon. Its creation represents [[Shar]]'s power to not only reward devotion but also to cleanse and repurpose artifacts of other, often opposed, powers.
