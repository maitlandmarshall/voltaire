## Backstory

### The Fall from Grace

Once the Prince of the Swamp, Voltaire ruled from a throne of curved wood and mud in a dense swamp kingdom where light barely penetrated to the muddy floor. His life changed forever during a fateful card game with visiting bards who bore gifts, wine, and song.

Unbeknownst to Voltaire, they were playing with the **Deck of Many Things**. Drawing two cards - the King of Spades and the Ace of Clubs - he was instantly transported to the Michaca desert, losing his Fae nature, his kingdom, and his memories of home. For months he wandered the desert in confusion, transformed from Fae royalty into something resembling humanity.

### The Transcription

A powerful wizard named Greg later used Voltaire (under the influence of a potion of haste) to transcribe both the **Book of Vile Darkness** and the **Book of Exalted Deeds**. Voltaire survived reading both tomes, creating a new unified text for Greg. This process left him with:

- The ability to unconsciously understand, read, and write **every language** in existence
- Deep, hidden knowledge of both ultimate good and ultimate evil
- Further transformation of his already fractured psyche

## Mysteries & Hooks

1. **The Sharite Dagger**: Why does he carry it? What's its significance?
2. **Lost Fae Nature**: Can it be recovered? Does he want it back?
3. **The Voidbone Pen**: Missing component for the Ink of Unbeing?
4. **True Patron**: Is he really his own patron, or is something else at work?
5. **The Books' Knowledge**: How does the Vile/Exalted knowledge manifest?
6. **Universal Language**: When will he discover this ability consciously?
