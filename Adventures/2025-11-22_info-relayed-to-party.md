Elora: She vanished
Cromash, Dagot h, Merci, Yennefer
The druid we saw in the moonpool is here in the temple. She
has been here over a thousand years. When this temple
sunk beneath the Anauroch desert she was isolated here
along with her 'flock', to preserved them they were
sequestered in the infinity circuit, I mean trees beneath us.
A few hundred years ago or so, hard to say for certain, the
druid performed some dark magic to prolong her ability to
protect her 'flock'. She seems to now be some plant/lich/elf
tied to the life force of the grove beneath us.
About a 100 years ago or so some outsiders managed to get
a foothold here in the temple and taint her mind, through
some means they were able to intimately take control of her
mind and body. They tainted, and released the souls
preserved in the trees, she now wa nders the halls broken by
her loss.I n f o r m a t i o n  r e l a y e d  t o  p a r t y

She is a very old druid who has become some sort of plant
based baelnorn. Her mind/soul might be beyond salvation. If
we need to fight her we should target the grove she draws
life from. But be careful of burning down the deeper temple
archives.
