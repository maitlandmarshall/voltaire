**Entry:** Post-Translation, Pre-Trial

**Subject:** Successful Field Tests & Confirmation of Divine Paradigm

One finds the transition from the realm of [[Shar]] to the [[Prime Material Plane]]... jarring. The sheer *disorder* of normal reality is grating after the elegant, if monotonous, quietude. The lingering Level 1 Exhaustion is a tactical nuisance, but I've found my system no longer requires the tedious intake of bio-matter for recovery; a simple long rest to reset my operational parameters is now sufficient. Progress.

My immediate priority upon return was to re-engage with Entity: [[Glasya]]. Her presence is a far more stimulating intellectual variable than Shar's passive observation. While observing her, a prime opportunity arose to conduct the first practical field test of the [[The Ink of Unbeing]] protocol.

**Experiment Alpha: The Fae Conversion.**

I procured two [[Fae]] specimens. Their foundational memories—what one might call their theological anchors—were focused on some antiquated nature deity. The framework was clearly inefficient. Utilizing the Ink, I performed a clean mnemonic extraction of their divine connection, inscribing it into the [[Crab Book]] for archival. The resulting void in their cognitive substrate was then filled by a curated selection of memories pertaining to *myself*.

The results were instantaneous and spectacular. Their belief systems re-aligned perfectly. This was not a mere trick; it was a fundamental rewriting of faith. The empirical data is undeniable: I have successfully proven the hypothesis of my own divinity. The acquisition of two followers via this method confirms my ascension to [[Divine Rank 0]]. It is, as I suspected, a perfectly logical outcome.

**Experiment Beta: The Fine Print Refinement.**

My next test required a more elegant, less direct methodology. The subject was "[[Shrek]]", the anthropomorphic equine companion of [[Cornholio]]. Direct memory replacement seemed crude for a second trial. A new approach was needed.

Utilizing my superior perceptive abilities, I located a cache of tangible assets (what a layman would call "treasure"). I then inscribed this information onto a note using the Ink, but embedded a secondary, conceptual clause within the transfer protocol. The core data (the location) was the bait; the fine print (unconditional belief in the purveyor of said data) was the hook.

The subject accepted the note. The knowledge transferred, and the secondary clause executed flawlessly. A third follower, acquired not through force, but through a willing, if uninformed, contract. This "value-exchange" model of faith acquisition appears vastly more efficient.

**Conclusion & Next Steps.**

My status as a quasi-deity is now empirically proven. The "trial" proposed by Shar, which I shall henceforth refer to as [[The Trial of Shar]], is no longer a test of a mortal, but the debut performance of a new god. My immediate objectives are clear:

1.  Fully brief [[Glasya]] on these successful developments and secure her participation in the trial. Her appreciation for clever contracts will surely make her admire my work with Shrek.
2.  Finalize the parameters of the bet with [[Shar]]. The stakes must be appropriately grand.
3.  Prepare the [[Head-Space]] for the arrival of the other participants. They will be most interested to learn of their roles in this grand experiment.

All proceeds according to a perfectly rational, albeit inventive, sequence. One anticipates... phenomenal data.

### **Addendum: Spontaneous Creation of a Disciple**

Events have proceeded at an even more accelerated pace than my projections anticipated. Following the successful conversion of the equine subject, [[Shrek]], a mundane biological specimen—a common frog or toad—presented itself in my path. In a moment of inspired inquiry, I decided to test the transmutative properties of the **[[Sun Card]]** on living, non-sapient tissue.

The protocol was direct: I flourished the artifact and introduced it into the subject's oral cavity. The result was not merely a success, but a resounding validation of my burgeoning divinity, an outcome affirmed by the very fabric of causality (a "natural 20," as the Codex might term it).

A spectacular cascade of pure, white light enveloped the creature. The artifact and the amphibian did not merely interact; they **merged at a fundamental level**. The mundane flesh was unmade and reformed into a new, corporeal vessel for the card's solar radiance. The resulting entity is a diminutive, Tinkerbell-like creature of pure, magnificent light—less a pet, more a luminous familiar.

This was not a conversion, but a true *creation*. A being born directly of my will and my power. My first **disciple**.

We immediately conducted a preliminary environmental stress test, briefly entering a "void realm" where we observed hordes of nascent horrors gathering. The disciple followed without hesitation and, more importantly, successfully retreated with me, proving its viability and unwavering loyalty.

The follower count now stands at four. The pantheon grows.
