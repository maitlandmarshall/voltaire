**Titles**: The Maid of Misfortune, Lady Doom
**Portfolio**: Bad luck, accidents, random mischief, misfortune
**Alignment**: Chaotic Evil

[[Beshaba]] is the Faerûnian Goddess of Misfortune, a malicious and fickle deity who governs ill fate and unlucky accidents. She is the dark and bitter twin of [[Tymora]], the Goddess of Good Fortune, and where Tymora offers a helping hand, Beshaba delights in kicking the ladder out from under mortals just to watch them fall. She is not a grand schemer like [[Shar]] or a politician like [[Glasya]]; her evil is petty, personal, and profoundly chaotic.

## Relationship with Voltaire

Voltaire's connection to Beshaba is one of deep, unrecognized thematic significance, which he characteristically ignores.

### A Life Defined by Misfortune

Voltaire's entire existence was upended by a single, calamitous draw from the **[[Deck of Many Things]]**—a pure game of chance. This event, which cost him his kingdom, his race, and his memory, was a textbook manifestation of Beshaba's power. Conversely, his survival and subsequent acquisition of the **Sun Card** represents a stroke of incredible good fortune, placing him squarely in the cosmic struggle between Beshaba and her sister. He is a walking paradox of luck and misfortune.

### Voltaire's Perspective: "Beshaba is a dood"

In a note within his module plans, [[Voltaire]]'s entire summation of the Maid of Misfortune is simply: "[[Beshaba]] is a dood."

This perfectly encapsulates his High INT/Low WIS worldview.
*   **(High Intellect)**: He likely understands Beshaba on a systemic level—as a personification of probability and negative outcomes.
*   **(Low Wisdom)**: He is utterly blind to the *malice* and *danger* she represents. He does not fear or respect her power, but rather sees her as just another player in the cosmic game. His casual dismissal is not bravery; it is a profound lack of common sense. He sees a fellow agent of chaos, not a goddess who would ruin a man's life for a moment's amusement.

## Beshaba's Inferred Interest

While [[Voltaire]] may be dismissive, Beshaba is almost certainly fascinated by him. A mortal who not only survived a life-altering stroke of misfortune but now actively makes high-stakes wagers with other gods is the greatest spectator sport she could imagine.

*   **A Source of Entertainment**: Voltaire's proposed "trial" with [[Shar]] is a petri dish of potential calamities. Beshaba is likely watching with keen interest, perhaps even subtly nudging events to ensure the most chaotic and unfortunate outcomes.
*   **A Potential Agent**: A mortal as chaotic and reckless as Voltaire is a perfect, if unwitting, agent for spreading misfortune across the planes.
*   **The Red Eyes**: While Voltaire suspects the red eyes he sees are [[Shar]], it's possible some belong to Beshaba, eagerly awaiting the next spectacular failure or unlucky roll of the dice.
