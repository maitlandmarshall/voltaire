**Titles**: Princess of the Sixth Hell, Daughter of Asmodeus
**Aliases**: Glasher
**Portfolio**: Contracts, Politics, Seduction, Power
**Domain**: Malbolge, the Sixth Layer of the Nine Hells

[[Glasya]] is an Archdevil of immense power and influence, the daughter of the supreme ruler of the Nine Hells, Asmodeus. She is a master of diabolical law, a cunning politician, and a being whose charm is matched only by her ruthlessness. Known for her intricate schemes and appreciation for novelty, she has recently become the subject of [[Voltaire]]'s intense and bizarre admiration.

## Narrative Arc & Key Events

Glasya's arrival in the Prime Material Plane was a direct result of the party's actions, and she has quickly established herself as a significant, if unpredictable, power player in [[Palashaey]].

### The Summoning

The party, following the instructions of a Demon Gate spell learned by [[Voltaire]], successfully gathered the necessary components (including demon milk) to summon a powerful devil. Their ritual brought Glasya herself to their plane, and she promptly claimed a throne room in the city of Palashaey, which is ruled by [[Cromash]]. Her presence has been met with a strange nonchalance by the local Warlock Knights, suggesting pre-existing contracts or a profound underestimation of the danger she represents.

### The Encounter at the Tiamat Shrine

Glasya was present during the chaotic battle that erupted from a failed containment spell at a Tiamat shrine. When a hole in reality was torn open, she took a commanding role, instructing the party to deal with the summoned creatures while she focused her considerable power on closing the portal. This event demonstrated her immense magical capability and her pragmatic, commanding nature when her interests are threatened. It was during this fight that Voltaire was transported to [[Shar]]'s realm.

## Relationship with Voltaire

Glasya's relationship with [[Voltaire]] is one of amused tolerance and calculating curiosity.
*   **The Courtship of Calisthenics**: Since her arrival, Voltaire has been relentlessly trying to impress her with physical exertion, performing endless burpees and push-ups in her presence. Rather than incinerating him for this absurdity, Glasya seems to find him "curious" and tolerates his presence.
*   **An Interesting Anomaly**: She appears to recognize that Voltaire is not a typical mortal. She once asked [[Cromash]], "Don't you find this curious?" while gesturing to a napping Voltaire, indicating she sees him as a strange puzzle worth observing.
*   **The Invitation**: Voltaire, in his grand proposal to [[Shar]], included Glasya on the guest list for his "Head-Space™" game. His reasoning was that she is "literate, inquisitive, and enjoys structured sin," and that she would appreciate his "quality literature." He sees her as an essential intellectual counterpoint for his game.
*   **Current Status**: Upon returning from Shar's realm, Voltaire's first act was to seek out Glasya again, likely to boast of his "negotiations" and formally recruit her for the upcoming "trial." His obsession with gaining her approval and attention remains a primary motivator.

## Inferred Motivations & Interests

Glasya is a schemer who plays the long game. Her interest in Voltaire is unlikely to be whimsical.
*   **Potential Asset**: She may see Voltaire's unique blend of power, knowledge (the latent Vile/Exalted books), and utter lack of common sense as a potentially useful, if unpredictable, tool. A mortal who can negotiate with [[Shar]] is a rare pawn.
*   **Entertainment**: The sheer novelty of Voltaire's behavior might be a refreshing break from the rigid, backstabbing politics of the Nine Hells.
*   **Information Gathering**: By keeping Voltaire close, she can observe the party and the developing situation with [[Shar]], a rival cosmic power. Voltaire is an unwitting font of strategic information.
