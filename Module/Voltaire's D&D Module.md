Voltaire's finally completed his flesh-horror-crab book, crafted with delicate care with the skins of the creatures past slain, inked in hell-hound blood and enchanted with the soul of a crab and merged together with Voltaire in both body and soul.

The book's title **[[Machinations & Actions - Player's Handbook]]** appears to be an intricate guide detailing the rules for a game played with dice.

Voltaire has invited the party, [[Shar]] and [[Glasya]] to play a game hosted within [[Voltaire]]'s mindspace. [[Shar]] declined the invitation to play, but agreed to facilitate invitations and attendance.
# Ideas

## **The Scribe's Folly**

**A One-Shot Adventure into the Mind of Voltaire**

### **Module Overview**

*   **Synopsis:** The player characters are unwillingly summoned into the mind of Voltaire the Black, a brilliant but dangerously unwise Warlock. Their trial begins with a perilous fall through a sky of shifting stories, navigating onto pop-up book islands patrolled by strange guards. Their journey culminates in a deadly Colosseum where the rules are arbitrary, the opponents are echoes of Voltaire's fractured past, and the only audience that matters is the unseen, capricious Scribe himself.
*   **Themes:** Psychological Horror, Loss of Agency, Unreliable Narrator, Meta-Narrative.
*   **Tone:** The adventure begins with unsettling, atmospheric horror, transitions into chaotic, high-action fantasy, and culminates in a tense, paranoia-inducing trial. Voltaire's presence should be felt everywhere but seen nowhere, until the very end.

**DM's Guide to Running Voltaire's Mind:**
*   **High Intelligence, Low Wisdom:** The world is intricate, complex, and follows a kind of logic, but it is a logic utterly devoid of common sense, empathy, or self-preservation. Puzzles should be intellectual but have absurd solutions.
*   **Everything is a Performance:** The mindscape is a stage. Events are structured for maximum "narrative yield." The unseen Voltaire is the director, and the party are his unwilling actors.
*   **Rules are Suggestions:** The laws of this reality are subject to the creator's whims. Be prepared to introduce arbitrary changes for dramatic effect. Voltaire's distorted voice might announce, "New rule! Gravity is now... optional! For a bit."

### **Adventure Hook: The Invitation Tendered**

This adventure begins immediately where the last session ended. Allow the party a few moments of normal roleplaying. If Voltaire is present, he's likely boasting about his "negotiations" with Shar. If he's absent, the party might be discussing him. Then, begin the transition.

**1. The Ominous Shift (Slow Burn):**
*   **The Silence:** All ambient sound fades to nothing over the course of a minute. The world becomes eerily quiet, leaving only the characters' voices and heartbeats.
*   **The Gloom:** Light sources dim. Colors desaturate. Shadows stretch and deepen, clinging to corners with unnatural stillness. A damp, cellar-like chill fills the air.
*   **The Whisper:** Each character, one by one, hears a cold, sibilant whisper that is *not* Voltaire's. It's the voice of **Shar**, facilitating the summons.
    > *"The Scribe awaits. Your invitation has been... tendered."*

**2. The Rip (The Horror Transition):**
*   Reality begins to peel away. The walls, floor, and sky curl back like old wallpaper, revealing layers of vellum, mad scribbles, and pulsating veins of black ink.
*   A sharp, tearing sound fills the silence. The air grows thick with the smell of decaying paper and ozone.
*   An irresistible force pulls the characters inward, their bodies feeling stretched and compressed as they're sucked through a vortex of paper and shadow. The last thing they hear is a cacophony of whispers and the amplified, rhythmic **scratching of a quill on parchment.**

---

### **Act I: The Grand Descent into Literature**

The party snaps back to their senses to find themselves **falling through an impossible sky.** Above them, the rip into reality shrinks into a chaotic tear. Below lies an archipelago of giant, open pop-up books.

**The Objective:** Survive the fall and aim for one of the book-islands below.

**Mechanics:**
*   Roll initiative. The fall lasts for **10 rounds**. At the end of each of their turns, every character falls **15 feet**.
*   Voltaire's distorted, pre-recorded voice booms: *"Ah, splendid! Arrivals are proceeding! Please select a thematic landing zone. Points for creativity are... under review!"*
*   **Navigation:** A character can use their movement and an **Acrobatics (DEX) or Athletics (STR) check (DC 14)** to steer their descent towards a specific island they can see. A **Perception (WIS) check (DC 13)** can reveal the theme of a distant island.

**The Pop-Up Book Islands (Examples):**
*   **The Somber Swamp:** A gloomy bog with paper lily pads and weeping willow trees. Mists curl from its pages.
*   **The Crimson Conflict:** A chaotic battlefield with paper soldiers, cut-out explosions, and siege engines.
*   **The Endless Archive:** Towering, intricate shelves of miniature books that seem to stretch for miles.
*   **The Geometric Axiom:** A stark, unsettling landscape of black and white patterns, cubes, and triangles.

**Aerial Encounters (Roll a d4 each round):**
1.  **Aggressive Glyphs:** A swarm of sharp-edged, glowing letters attacks. (Use **Swarm of Bats** stats, but they are constructs and deal slashing damage).
2.  **Binding Straps:** Giant leather book straps whip out from the void, attempting to Grapple one character (DEX save DC 13 to avoid).
3.  **Ink Blot:** A semi-sentient ink blot splatters on one character, blinding them for one round (CON save DC 12 to resist).
4.  **Quiet Round:** The wind whispers cryptic rules or fragments of Voltaire's memories.

### **Act II: The Archipelago of Thought**

Upon landing on an island, the characters have a moment to orient themselves. The roar of a distant crowd is now unmistakable.

**The Objective:** Traverse the archipelago to reach the central Colosseum island.

**The Landing Zone:** The chosen island provides a minor, one-time boon.
*   **Swamp:** Gain 5 temporary hit points from the life-giving paper mulch.
*   **Conflict:** The first successful attack roll you make is a critical hit.
*   **Archive:** You find a "Torn Page" containing a 1st-level spell scroll of the DM's choice.
*   **Axiom:** You may choose to have resistance to one damage type, but you gain vulnerability to another for the duration of this adventure.

**The Guardians ("Editorial Enforcers"):**
The shores of each island are patrolled by shadowy guards made of compressed paper, armed with oversized quill spears. (Use **Guard** stats, but they are constructs).
*   **Behavior:** They are not immediately hostile. Their goal is to **enforce the narrative**. They will block any attempt to fly or swim directly to the Colosseum, pointing with their quills toward designated "paths" (bridges made of book spines, glowing lines of ink).
*   **Interaction:** They can be fought, but they can also be tricked. They are susceptible to Voltaire's brand of flawed logic. A successful **Deception (CHA) or Persuasion (CHA) check (DC 15)**, phrased as a clever rules-lawyering argument, might convince them to stand down or reveal a shortcut. (e.g., "According to narrative convention, the protagonists are *supposed* to find a hidden route!").

### **Act III: The Colosseum of Unreliable Rules**

The paths converge at the entrance to a massive Colosseum built of books and crab shells. The roar is deafening. Once inside, the gates slam shut.

**The Announcer:** Voltaire's disembodied voice echoes, filled with cheerful, clinical excitement. He is the unseen master of ceremonies.

**Round 1: The Warm-Up - Echoes of the Past**
The party faces manifestations of Voltaire's memories.
*   **Enemies:** 2x **Fae Echoes** (use **Specter** stats, but they deal psychic damage with their "Sorrowful Touch") and 1x **Jilted Demon's Grudge** (use **Shadow** stats).
*   **Voltaire's Commentary:** *"First up, some lingering regrets and a minor contractual dispute! Let's see how our subjects handle unresolved trauma! Fascinating!"*

**Round 2: The Practicum - A Test of the Codex**
Voltaire decides to test a creature from his "Handbook."
*   **Enemy:** 1x **Ink-Stained Horror** (use **Hook Horror** stats, but it's an Aberration made of shifting, dripping ink).
*   **Voltaire's Commentary:** *"Hmm, the challenge rating feels a bit low for this creature's listed abilities. Let's make a small adjustment... All attacks against it now have disadvantage! Let's see how that affects the data!"* (This effect lasts for 2 rounds).

**Round 3: The Main Event - Narrative Imperative**
The final, cruelest test.
*   **The Setup:** The arena floor floods with shadowy, illusory copies of each party member. For every real character, there are two **Illusory Doppelgangers**.
*   **Voltaire's Commentary:** *"Excellent! Now for the climax! A test of identity and conviction! But to raise the stakes, a **Glyph of Narrative Importance** will now manifest! Only one true soul may claim it to be declared the protagonist! Show me who it will be!"*
*   **The Twist:** A glowing, pulsating glyph appears in the center of the arena. The Illusory Doppelgangers (AC 12, 1 HP) will try to stop anyone from reaching the glyph. They move towards the closest real character and make a single, weak attack (+2 to hit, 1 psychic damage) before dissolving. The main challenge is the confusion and the paranoia of targeting allies.
*   **Winning:** The trial ends when one player character touches the glyph. They are the "winner."

---

### **Concluding the Adventure**

The moment a character touches the glyph, the entire mindscape freezes. The roar of the crowd cuts to silence. All illusory figures vanish. The voice of Voltaire speaks, this time sounding thoughtful and close.

> *"Protagonist identified. Conclusion... satisfactory. The data is rich. End simulation."*

The world dissolves into white light. The party awakens exactly where they were before the "rip," mere moments having passed in the real world.

**The Aftermath:**
*   Each character feels mentally exhausted but is otherwise unharmed.
*   The "winner" of the trial retains a faint, glowing glyph on the back of their hand. For the next 24 hours, they have **Advantage on one saving throw of their choice**. The glyph then fades.
*   Each party member now carries a shared, fragmented memory of the event, a key that might allow them to be pulled back into Voltaire's mindscape later. The door has been opened.
